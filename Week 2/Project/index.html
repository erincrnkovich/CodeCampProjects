<div class="box">“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot 
    be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.”
</div>
<div class="box">“Take the universe as a whole, and it is a very clever conception and quite competently carried out, but I don’t think much of this globe as a work of art. It would have been better 
    to take more time to it and do it right, it seems to me, than to rush it through, helter-skelter, in six days, just for reputation.”
</div>
<div class="box">“I have found out there ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them.”
</div>
<div class="box">“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back 
    to where you started is not the same as never leaving.”
</div>
<div class="box">“It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.”
