# Quiz Game Requirements

Your task is to build a simple web-based quiz game where a user can answer a series of multiple-choice questions.

## Core Requirements

### Questions

- The quiz should contain a series of questions. Each question is a multiple-choice question with one correct answer.
- Each question and its set of answers should be displayed on screen.
- The user selects an answer by clicking on it.

### Scoring

- The game keeps track of the number of questions the user has answered correctly.
- Each correct answer earns one point. Incorrect answers do not lose points.

### Results

- After the user has answered all the questions, the game should display the user's total score.

## Bonus Requirements

- Add a timer. If the user does not answer all the questions before the time runs out, it ends and it calculates the score.
- Display the correct answer if the user answers a question incorrectly.
- Allow the user to try again without refreshing the page.
- Keep track of and display the highest score the user has achieved.
